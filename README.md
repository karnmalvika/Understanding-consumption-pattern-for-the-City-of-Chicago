Understanding consumption pattern for the City of Chicago using SQL and Tableau
Considered parameters are as follows:
1. Energy usage by asset class (residential, commercial etc)
2. Energy efficiency based on building type (High rise, stand alone, warehouse etc)
3. Factoring building age- Are older buildings more or less efficient?
4. Building size
5. Household size
6. Occupancy rate
7. Seasonal variance using monthly data

RESEARCH OBJECTIVES:
• What are the most and least energy efficient buildings?

• What are the factors that most effect energy efficiency for a building?

• How can the City of Chicago use this data to reduce it’s current total energy
load?

• What future norms should they adopt for new buildings?
